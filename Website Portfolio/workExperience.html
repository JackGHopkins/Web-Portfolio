          	<h3>Retail Assistant | <br> <i>Windsor Castle</i> | <br><span class="subtitle">June 2019 - September 2019</span></h3>

          	<p>Over the summer of 2019 I worked for the Royal Collections. I worked 40 hours per week at Windsor Castle. My duties included serving at the checkout,
               stocking shelves and writing home deliveries. I worked in a variety of shops—from Jewelry to an Ice Cream
                Van—selling Vikki Sarge Necklaces to blackcurrant ice cream.

      		  	Learning how to interact with people from all walks of life was fundamental to the job, even if we didn't speak the same language.
            	Being ready to go out of your way to make someone's a little brighter was something
            	I tried to do regularly. It helped me grow by forcing me to go out of my way to talk to people I have never met and may never see again.

      	  <h3>Packing Assistant | <i>The Blossoms Of Windsor LTD</i> | December 2017 - May 2018</h3>

       		<p>I had the pleasure of stepping into a new cultural bubble when working at Blossoms. It was a Chinese take-away and I would come in on peak hours and help get food
        	out of the door to hungry customers. It made me appreciate the amount of work and dedication these people put into their work, something as simple as Chicken Chow Mein would be
        	prepared with such skill that it was a joy to watch. </br> </br>I worked on Christmas Eve in my first month there which was a cultural shock to me, but unsurprisingly it was as busy as ever, if
        	not more! During my time there, I learnt how to be aware of my surroundings and work under a lot of time pressure.

        	<p>For 5 weeks over the 2016 and 2017 summer, I would work doing a vast array of tasks. Whether it was cleaning toilets, preparing food for up to 215 kid, leading a cabin of 12 with a Staff member for a week,
        	SunnyBrae taught me a lot about service even when there was no obvious reward. Serving is a valuable skill that I am so glad to have learnt. </br> </br>Having to work full out for to make a week the best week
        	for the summer for these kids, while working in a team of 30 was draining yet rewarding.

        	<p>I have grown up going to Church, however when my parents started a plant back in 2014, I’ve helped almost every week. Whether it be any combination of drumming, setting up, sound or prayers etc.
        	</br> </br>I became a bit of an odd jobs man, as people from church asked me to help them out during the week. Whether it be cleaning up someone's laptop, painting a gate, or cutting a hedge, I would be the guy to call.

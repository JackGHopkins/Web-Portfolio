          	<p>This game was the product of the Ludum Dare 44 GameJam, where 2 different friends and I created a game in 72 hours.
                The game was made around the theme "Life is Currency". Thus calls, like most GameJams, on your creative ability in
                design and ingenuity.
                It was a stressful yet fun experience and this has helped me work under pressure well. I also improved my experience
                with Tile-Sheets and it is good to get a finished product out there, even if it was a little rushed. This was another
                example of where learning scope and being realistic is important.

      		  	This project was a tower defence game that took a similar format to <i>Plants Vs. Zombies</i> where you would have 5 animals
                that do different things, as other animals attempted to attack you farm, stealing you livestock,
	               thus draining your currency/money.

       		<p>To be perfectly honest it feels a bit weird talking about my YouTube Channel so publicly.
      		Kids at school got picked on for having YouTube Channel. While much of it is not a work of art and I don't watch older  stuff
      		without cringing, I am not ashamed of my attempts and seeing me grow and progress is incredibly fun. I have posted a    lot less
                since I started University to focus on that, but I am glad to have this to post my thoughts on writing and characters when I find
      		    the time.

                I treat it like a photo album of all the fun times I have had playing games with my friends.
                As for skills learnt, video editing and marketing has been something I have had to learnt to get anywhere on YouTube. Also being
      		    able to deal with harsh criticism and turn it into something positive is a must to survive on the internet.

        	<h3>EPQ Project | <i>Pincic Pillager</i></h3>

        	<p>During year 13 of school, I decided to take up a research project that investigates intuitive game design in classic    video games such as
                <i>Super Mario Bros</i> and <i>Mega Man</i>. Picking apart the practises of the game developers and looking into opinions of industry experts
      		    and game designers of the modern day. From that I created my own game with one level, applying what I learnt into one level, where anyone could
                sit down and play the game to completion with any verbal instructions. For this project I used Construct 2, and     created the game logic, design,
			     art, music and sound FX.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                From this I learnt many things, such as basic industry practises for planning. And how to monitor my own work, and keep going even when
				I find it hard. How to take feedback on a project I spent so much time on, was also a great skill to learn.
				To not take anything to critically and take the sometimes harsh truth of the situation and deal with that emotionally.

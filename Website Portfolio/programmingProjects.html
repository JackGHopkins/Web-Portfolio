                        <h3>GMTK Jam 2021 | <br><span class="subtitle">Game Will TEAR Communities ASUNDER!</span></h3>

                        <p>In June 2021, my and 3 other Uni friends created a game in 48hrs for the GMTK Jam 2021. The theme for 
                            weekend was "Joined Together". The setting of the game is that you are a journalist and you have to
                            balance between managing you finances and polarising / clickable articles. It demands you to keep
                             society joined together while also not going bankrupt.
                            <br />
                            <br /> 
                            Our project was ranked 860th out of 5800+ submissions. Noticably, we got 423rd on "Presentation" 
                            which was the part of the project I was leading. 

                            <br />
                            <br /> 
                            I am currently expanding on/cleaning up this with one friend to make it more complete.

                        <p>This game was the product of the Ludum Dare 44 GameJam, where 2 friends and I created a game in 72 hours. The game was made around the theme "Life is Currency". This calls, like most GameJams, on your creative ability in design
                            and ingenuity. It was a stressful yet fun experience and this has helped me work under pressure well. I also improved my experience with Tile-Sheets and it is good to get a finished product out there, even if it was a little
                            rushed. This was another example of where learning scope and being realistic is important.
                            <br />
                            <br /> This project was a tower defence game that took a similar format to <i>Plants Vs. Zombies</i> where you would have 5 animals that do different things, as other animals attempted to attack your farm, stealing your livestock,
                            thus draining your currency.

                    <h3>EPQ Project | <i>Pincic Pillager</i></h3>

                    <p>During year 13 of school, I decided to take up a research project that investigates intuitive game design in classic video games such as
                        <i>Super Mario Bros</i> and <i>Mega Man</i>; picking apart the practises of the game developers and looking into opinions of industry experts and game designers of the modern day. From that I created my own game with one level,
                        applying what I learnt into one level, where anyone could sit down and play the game to completion without any verbal instructions. For this project I used
                        <i>Construct 2</i>, and created the game logic, design, art, music and sound FX.
                        <br />
                        <br /> From this project I learnt many things including basic industry practices for planning, how to monitor my own work, and how keep going even when I find it hard. I also learnt how to take feedback and deal with my emotions;
                        not to take criticism too personally and accept the sometimes harsh truth of the situation.
                    </p>

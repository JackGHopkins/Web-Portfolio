            <h3>Ludum Dare 44 | <br><span class="subtitle">Old Macdonald's Farm</span></h3>

          	<p>This game was the product of the Ludum Dare 44 GameJam, where 2 friends and I created a game in 72 hours.
                The game was made around the theme "Life is Currency". This calls, like most GameJams, on your creative ability in
                design and ingenuity. It was a stressful yet fun experience and this has helped me work under pressure well. I also improved my experience
                with Tile-Sheets and it is good to get a finished product out there, even if it was a little rushed. This was another
                example of where learning scope and being realistic is important.

      		  	This project was a tower defence game that took a similar format to <i>Plants Vs. Zombies</i> where you would have 5 animals
                that do different things, as other animals attempted to attack your farm, stealing your livestock,
	               thus draining your currency.

       		<p>To be perfectly honest it feels a bit weird talking about my YouTube Channel so publicly.
      		Kids at school got picked on for having a YouTube Channel. While much of it is not a work of art and I don't watch older stuff
      		without cringing, I am not ashamed of my attempts and seeing me grow and progress is incredibly fun. I haven't posted as much since
          I started University, but I am glad to have this platform to post my thoughts on writing and themes in story telling when I find
      		the time.

                I treat it like a photo album of all the fun times I have had playing games with my friends.
                As for skills learnt, video editing and marketing has been something I have had to learn to get anywhere on YouTube. Also being
      		    able to deal with harsh criticism and turn it into something positive is a must to survive on the internet.

        	<h3>EPQ Project | <i>Pincic Pillager</i></h3>

        	<p>During year 13 of school, I decided to take up a research project that investigates intuitive game design in classic video games such as
              <i>Super Mario Bros</i> and <i>Mega Man</i>; picking apart the practises of the game developers and looking into opinions of industry experts
      		    and game designers of the modern day. From that I created my own game with one level, applying what I learnt into one level, where anyone could
              sit down and play the game to completion without any verbal instructions. For this project I used <i>Construct 2</i>, and created the game logic, design,
			        art, music and sound FX.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                From this project I learnt many things including basic industry practices for planning, how to monitor my own work, and how keep going even when I find it hard.
                 I also learnt how to take feedback and deal with my emotions; not to take criticism too personally and accept the sometimes harsh truth of the situation.

      <h3>I’m Jack, I like to make things.</h3>

      <p>For a long time, I have been someone who likes to take smaller objects and use them to make bigger objects.
        Getting stuck into small projects has been something I have liked to do since I was young. Whether it be helping
        build bridges with my Grandpa for his creak in Canada or solving puzzles after day-care with my Mum. I like
        solving puzzles so much that my cousins started calling me <i>“Jigsaw Jack”</i>. <br /> <br />
		I have always loved act of creating and the satisfaction that comes along with it. Art to me is as much as a
        puzzle it is as an expression. Finding which strokes go where and so on. Smaller items evolving to one larger one.
        This has shown itself most in Video Editing for my YouTube Channels over the years and drawing sketches I do in my free time.<br /> <br /></p>



     	<p>It was only till 2017 that the thought of making creating into a career dawned on me and I started making Video games
        with my friends in my free time. Designing and creating Art for at first a Pokémon Spin off and now has turned into
        a company which I am lead artist for. Since taking up code in my spare time I have also found I enjoy solving logical problems.<br /> <br /></p>

     <p>Playing sports and keeping active has also been a big part of my life. I’ll play any sport as long as people are having fun,
        whether it is competitive or something more causal. I personally love to see when people get a long and if something is wrong, I
        try and find a way to solve it. <br /> <br /></p>

      <p>I hope to grow in many areas, however, I hope to improve my skills in programming and art the most. My friends and I plan to
        have a game commercially available in the next 2 years with <i>Astral Dawn Studios</i>.<br /> <br />

      Whether it be drumming for church, making game animations or understanding game design better, I hope to always improve and learn.
         I’m no finished project but that just inspires me to do better.<br /> <br /></p>
